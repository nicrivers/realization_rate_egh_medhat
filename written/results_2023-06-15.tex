\begin{frame}{Sun + Abraham estimates}
	The Sun and Abraham correction is estimated by interacting a cohort dummy with a time-to-treatment dummy. In our monthly data, we observe 49 different ``cohorts'' (i.e., households retrofit in 49 different months).  Our data has 250 different ``time to treatments'' (i.e., months before and after retrofit). This implies estimating a model with about 10,000 dummy variables.  This is not feasible. Instead, to estimate the Sun and Abraham model, I convert to annual data first. The results first show the TWFE estimates based on annual data.

\begin{frame}{Manual cohort-by-cohort analysis}
	The Sun and Abraham estimator (like other new TWFE estimators) is simply as weighted aggregate of DID estimators for all treated cohorts. To better understand what's going on, I am going to manually estimate treatment effects for all cohorts.  In doing so, I can also decompose the treatment effect into three types of comparisons (a la Goodman-Bacon): treated vs. never treated; later treated vs. earlier treated; and earlier treated vs. later treated.  Using earlier treatments as controls is the potentially problematic case.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dynamic cohort effects}
	In the following slide, I use the participants only sample, and only make ``good'' comparisons -- i.e., comparing earlier treated (the treatment group) with not-yet-treated (the control group) households. I run the regression for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 cohorts.  I drop years between the pre- and post-retrofits.  The treatment effects are very similar to what we observed earlier under the TWFE estimator. They are NOT the same as under the Sun and Abraham estimator.

\begin{frame}{Now, I use the data WITH untreated households, and illustrate DID results from all possible comparisons.  I do this graphically, but also show a regression coefficient.  I didn't drop the between-retrofit period in producing these figures (although I could).}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
	All of these comparisons reveal a coefficient of around 16\%, just like our main estimates in the current version of the paper.  This leads me to think that I have not estimated the Sun and Abraham model properly, and that the effect of retrofits really is an energy saving of approximately 16\%. Moreover, the event study plot in slide 9 looks ``wrong'': with the particpants only sample, it should not be possible to estimate coefficients on treatment+4 years or more, since we don't observe an appropriate control group.
